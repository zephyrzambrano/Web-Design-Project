      <h1>About MySQL</h1>
      <p>MySQL was originally created by MySQL AB, but it was eventually purchased and owned by Sun Microsystems.
        Today, it is owned and developed by the Oracle Corporation, which ended up purchasing Sun Microsystems.
        MySQL is a RDBMS, or relational database management system. It is also open source. SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
        MySQL is called MySQL instead of just SQL because one of the developers added “My” at the beginning to name it after his daughter.
        MySQL is used with several AMP software stacks, such as LAMP, WAMP, AND MAMP. C and C++ were used to create MySQL, and MySQL can be
        used with various programming languages. MySQL can be used with a GUI, or graphical user interface, or with the command line. There
        are various GUI options for users to choose from, but running MySQL with the command line involves a lot of learning for users who are
        not familiar with the command line. MySQL is currently running version 8.0, but versions 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7 are still supported.
        When MySQL AB was purchased by Sun Microsystems, development for publicly released versions of MySQL went straight to version 8.0.</p>
