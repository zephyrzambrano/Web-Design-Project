      <h1>Node.js</h1>
      <p>Node.js is a recent development in web technology. Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript that allows JavaScript to
        run without a web browser. This allows the JavaScript to run on the server before a user even opens the web page and has the
        html run the script. This is called server-side scripting. Without Node.js, the JavaScript in a web page can only be run when
        the user opens said web page. Ryan Dahl, working for the software company Joyent, created Node.js because he wanted to make a
        better web server than Apache HTTP Server. He ran the Node.js development project from 2009 to 2012, and Isaac Schlueter took
        over managing the project. The development of Node.js was affected by internal clashes within the Joylent company in 2014, but
        development was streamlined again in 2015. Node.js is currently running versions 8 and 10. Version 12 is scheduled to release in
        2019. Version 6 is currently in a maintenance release, and will no longer be supported in mid 2019. Versions 5, 7, 9, and 11 are
        no longer supported, as they were not scheduled to be under long term maintenance. Versions 0.10, 0.12, and 4 are no longer supported.
